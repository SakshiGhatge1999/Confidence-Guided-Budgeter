# Confidence-Guided Budgeter (CGB)

## Overview
A hybrid ML framework for credit risk assessment that balances accuracy and interpretability. The system defaults to a transparent Logistic Regression model and only switches to a Random Forest when confidence is high.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: 
   `git clone https://github.com/SakshiGhatge1999/Confidence-Guided-Budgeter.git`
2. Install the required libraries: 
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `CGB(phase 3).ipynb`.
2. Run all cells to reproduce the data preprocessing, arbitration loop, and statistical validation.

## Results
The system achieved a **Trust Reliance Ratio of 72.2%** with a hybrid accuracy of **70.9%**.
